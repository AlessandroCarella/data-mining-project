scaling (from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)

types of clustering:
Hierarchical Clustering 
Hierarchical Clustering with complete linkage
Hierarchical Clustering with single link
Hierarchical Clustering with group average
k-means
Bisecting K-Means
X-Means
K-Modes
Mixture Gaussian Model
dbscan
OPTICS
HDBSCAN

measures and visualizations for quality of clusterings:
visualization of Hierarchical Clustering with Dendrograms
entropy and relative visualization
sse and relative visualization for a number of clusters from 0 to 50 when it's possible to set how many clusters there should be
sse for the comparison of each couple of clusters 
correlation matrixes and relative visualization
clusters Cohesion
cluster Separation
silhouette coefficent for each cluster
silhouette coefficent for cluster to cluster (1 to 1) comprarison
general silhouette coefficent 
countplot for each feature and each clusters in each clustering method (as in line 17 in the clustering_iris.ipynb from dm1_lab03_clustering)
kth neighbor distance (line 38 in the clustering_iris.ipynb from dm1_lab03_clustering)
