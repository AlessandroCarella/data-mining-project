For naive bayes models, is more robust to normalize the data and 
    one-hot encode your categorical variables.

Then it's also important to divide the model estimation between 
    continuous and categorical variables, in this way we can say that
    i.e: for continuous we can use, gaussian naive bayes, and for categorical
    we can use either multinomial naive bayes or bernouli naive bayes
